## Flight Delay Prediction Using Machine Learning

Problem Statement: 
Flight delay cost US alone 33 billion dollars according to CAPA, main reason for flight delays are staff shortage and Extreme weather conditions, extreme weather condition is a unavoidable and uncertain in most cases, extreme weather conditions on either airports whether arrival or departure air port leads to flight delay.

Aim:
Predict the delay of flight based on weather condition on both departure and arrival airport

Solution: 
collect weather data and flight data on airports pre process the data for machine learning application and merge the data on logical conditions, apply various machine learning models and evaluate their accuracy

Result: 
Flight delay prediction using machine learning methods brings more than 90% prediction accuracy
